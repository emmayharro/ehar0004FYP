# Simulating Optical Injection Locking for Optical Communication Systems
Final Year Project for Monash University ECSE 

Student: Emily Harrison
Supervisor: Dr Bill Corcoran

To inspect the implementation of the technique and produce your own results, you'll need **DPMQAM_Rx** and the DSP_stack_modules folder.

To recreate the plots seen in the report/poster/video, the data and example plots are in **experiment_compare**.

**Lorentzian_compare** was used to observe the relationship between the gap between sub-bands and the HWHM of the filter.
**BW_filter_compare** was used to set the width of the filter for the Modified Fragkos Filter.
**aux_recovery_compare** shows the effect of removing the maximum-likelihood recovery function.
**tone_compare** shows the sweep used to determine the optimal value for the tone_factor.
**distance_compare** shows that the chromatic dispersion compensation function used is effective until a transmission distance of 100km.
